```

### Environment Configuration

#### Backend Configuration
Create authentication configuration file:
```bash
cd backend/src/authentication
cp access.json.example access.json
```

Edit `access.json` to configure your initial admin user:
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin123",
      "role": "admin",
      "email": "admin@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Default credentials are `admin/admin123`. Change these immediately after first login.

#### Frontend Configuration
Create environment configuration:
```bash
cd frontend
echo "PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000" > .env
```

For production environments:
```bash
echo "PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com" > .env
```

        script: `
          echo "Preparing deployment environment..."
          export NODE_ENV=production
          export BUILD_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
          mkdir -p logs
        `
      },
      {
        stageId: "build", 
        script: `
          echo "Building application..."
          npm ci --production
          npm run build
          tar -czf build-$BUILD_ID.tar.gz dist/
        `
      },
      {
        stageId: "deploy",
        script: `
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          systemctl stop myapp
          cp -r dist/* /var/www/myapp/
          systemctl start myapp
          echo "Deployment completed successfully!"
        `
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

5. **Set Permissions**: Assign user access levels per project

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Staging Configuration

#### Multi-Stage Deployment Example
```bash
# Stage 1: Environment Setup
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Environment Setup ==="
#DEFINE APP_VERSION=v2.1.0
#DEFINE DEPLOY_ENV=production
echo "App version: #APP_VERSION"
echo "Deploy environment: #DEPLOY_ENV"

# Stage 2: Pre-deployment Checks  
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Pre-deployment Validation ==="
echo "Validating environment: #DEPLOY_ENV"
echo "Target version: #APP_VERSION"

# Check system requirements
if [ ! -d "/var/www" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: /var/www directory not found"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Pre-deployment checks passed ‚úì"

# Stage 3: Application Deployment
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Application Deployment ==="
echo "Deploying #APP_VERSION to #DEPLOY_ENV"

# Create backup
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/app-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_DIR"

# Simulate deployment
echo "Installing version #APP_VERSION..."
sleep 2
echo "Configuring for #DEPLOY_ENV environment..."
sleep 1
echo "Starting services..."
sleep 1

echo "Deployment of #APP_VERSION completed successfully! ‚úì"
```

### üîß Git Operations

#### Git Workflow Examples
Available Git operations in the UI:

1. **View Recent Commits**: Displays last 10 commits with hash, author, date, and message
2. **List Branches**: Shows all available branches with current branch highlighted  
3. **Switch Branches**: Change to a different branch via dropdown selection
4. **Revert to Commit**: Reset HEAD to a specific commit hash

#### Git Integration Examples
1. **Pre-deployment Branch Check**:
   ```bash
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Not on main branch ($CURRENT_BRANCH)"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Automated Tagging**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" -m "Production deployment"
   git push origin --tags
   ```

### üìä Execution Monitoring

#### Real-time Execution Features
- **Live Console Output**: Stream command execution in real-time
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators for multi-stage deployments  
- **Error Handling**: Automatic capture of exit codes and error outputs
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution duration and resource usage

#### Execution History API
```javascript
// Fetch execution history
GET /api/execution-history?projectId=123&limit=50

// Example response
{
  "executions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "projectId": 123,
      "userId": 5,
      "status": "success",
      "command": "deploy-webapp production --verbose",
      "workingDirectory": "/var/www/myapp",
      "duration": 45230,  // milliseconds
      "executedAt": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "finishedAt": "2024-01-15T14:30:45Z",
      "output": "Deployment completed successfully!",
      "exitCode": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### üë• Permission Management

#### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// User Roles and Capabilities
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN = "admin",    // Full system access
  USER = "user",      // Project execution and viewing  
  VIEWER = "viewer"   // Read-only access
}

// Project-Level Permissions
enum PermissionType {
  EXECUTE = "execute",                    // Run staging configurations
  VIEW = "view",                         // View project details
  EDIT = "edit",                         // Modify project settings
  VIEW_LOGS = "view_logs",               // Access execution logs
  VIEW_EXECUTION_HISTORY = "view_execution_history"  // Access historical data
}
```

#### Managing User Permissions
```javascript
// Grant specific permissions to user for project
POST /api/permissions
{
  "userId": 123,
  "projectId": 456, 
  "permissions": ["execute", "view", "view_logs"]
}

// Bulk permission update
PUT /api/users/123/permissions
{
  "globalPermissions": ["view", "execute"],
  "projectPermissions": {
    "456": ["edit", "view_logs"],
    "789": ["view"]
  }
}
```

### üîÑ Scheduled Deployments (Cron Jobs)

#### Setting up Automated Deployments
Each project can have a cron schedule configured through the UI or API:

**Via Project Settings UI:**
1. Open a project
2. Navigate to the Cron tab
3. Set schedule using presets (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) or custom cron expression
4. Save configuration

**Via API:**
```javascript
// Configure cron job for project
POST /api/projects/123/cron
{
  "cronExpression": "0 2 * * 1-5"  // Monday to Friday at 2 AM
}
```

#### Cron Expression Examples
```bash
# Every day at midnight
"0 0 * * *"

# Every weekday at 6 PM  
"0 18 * * 1-5"

# Every 30 minutes during business hours
"*/30 9-17 * * 1-5"

# First day of every month at 3 AM
"0 3 1 * *"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
